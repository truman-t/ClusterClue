# ClusterClue
A data pipeline to detect Star Clusters using Gaia DR3. The detection method relies on two main steps that combine unsupervised and supervised learning. First, the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN searches cluster candidates using the astrometric position of stars. Second, a trained neural network validates a candidate exploding its CMD.
